v0.3.1 (wip)

+ Port build system to Dune 3
  * We need to set `version` manually, so that `dune`
    won't try to run `git`.
  * The `bytes` module (from base) can no longer be
    specified manually. This broke with the upgrade
    from OCaml 4.14 to 5.1, but I don't know precisely
    when it stopped working nor whether it was ever
    necessary.
  * The extra logic to install e.g. the rendered
    changelog can be removed now, as dune seems
    to do this by default.

v0.3

+ Compatibility with newer dependencies
  Fixes build for Jingoo >= 1.3.0 and Angstrom >= 0.14.0
+ Don't change text in no markup mode
  Previously everything got wrapped with `<p>` and `</p>`
  in order to emulate the behavior of markdown markup.
  The old behavior can be restored using the new switch
  `--paragraph`.
+ Allow empty lines in indented blocks
  This allows for empty lines in item text blocks being
  passed to the markup by using a lines only containing
  2 spaces (i. e. an indented new line).
+ Allow custom templates to be used
  A jingoo template can now be passed using `--template`
  to be used instead of the default one.
+ Make `--file` option non-mandatory
  If not given, `logbook` reads from stdin.
+ Improve default template
  * Generate HTML `id`s in the default template.
    This allows for linking to single entries using
    `file.html#YYYY-MM-DD`.
  * Put item title and text in separate `<div>`s. This
    makes sure that there is at least line break distinguishing
    them regardless of markup used.
+ Add `--title` option
  Used to set the HTML `<title>` in the default template.
  Also passed to custom templates.
+ Add man pages
  logbook(1) for utility, logbook-log(7) for file format
  and logbook-template(7) for templating information.
