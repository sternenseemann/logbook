Entry without items works, too.

Got the log parser into a working state

+ Implemented Angstrom parsers
  Still kinda ugly and not perfect, need a bit of work.
- This is private
  Well not really, just testing this outâ€¦

[2017-02-17]
Implemented logbook cli

+ Open & parse file
  This is done using LWT and Angstrom.
+ Reworked parser
  I applied more applicative style, making the parser much better.
  Also I fixed an annoying bug, where you could not omit the empty line between items.
* This is a Semi Private entry
  Again: including it in a public repository defeats its purpose.
  
  Above is an empty line in a block (indented using 2 spaces).
